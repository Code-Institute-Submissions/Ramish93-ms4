## project name and summry of concept
# Takhleeq Kada
* As i am learning new technologies with the course it getting easier to use those technologies and make something useful with them on the web. so this project is a reflection of that. this is a financial website that,
* Let user browser through login/ register.
* saves users data in postgreSQL.
* let user perform CRUD function on their data.
* lets user add products to cart and remove them.
* with stripe library, lets user pay with credit card.

## __Overview__:
I designed this website in three pages with same navigation, Gallery and Orders, footer section to show consistancy to user and so that they can move around and find register and login information not matter which page they are on.
A vast increase in technology is pushing us all to make new thing and create from what we have.
The goal of web-app is to let user see and order __interior designs__ for their home and then user are able to perform CURD functionality on it so With the intuative design and easy register user would appriciate a simple easy to navigate but effective design.
## __Description__:
* it is a Interior design financial web-app that is intended to be accessible on all devices. My goal in this project was to avoid the overinfomation, and to create a good and positive user-experience with ease of user and navigation that will in future boost the company's image and business goals.

## UX
### __Strategy__
The idea behind this website is to make user of the technologies learnt throughout the course into making something useful for users and simple. As tremendous increase in technogy it is imparitive to learn new tech and then utilize it into small projects in order to learn them effectivly.
#### Website Goals:
* The basic goal of this web-app is to make a platform for users that is easy to navigate and easy to use and then browser through my existing designs that were done for other customers and then add/remove them to their cart which will be saved in data-base and they are then able to perform CURD functionality on it.
* My target audiance is busy people. With this website they will be able to find a design of their liking and then just purchase it. without the hassle of mattching contrasting.

#### User goals are:
* We all love to use technology that is less complicated to interact with and more efficient in its ways.
* A simple yet effictive interface can attract users attention and neatly layedout designs to help user see easily.
* A clear fixed navbar is there to make sure that a user if gets lost they can go to desired place with one click.
* All these features mentioned above are included in the project alonge with ability to save data into a data-base and read, create and delete it. 

This website would be great in acheiving these goals mentioned above because:

* It would provide a platform for users to go and make their dream home.
* Helping them with easy navigation to register, login, log-out.
* Paricipents will be able to perform CURD functionality on their data.
* A clean sophisticated landing page which is easy to navigate can boost a user and take less time to get the job done.

#### Developement and Bussiness goals:
* A website created to help people make their dream home or room in small easy steps.
* A website created with HTML5, CSS3 and bootstrap framework, and backend with python Django framework which is exciting and motivating to look at.
* I am as a developer happy and excited to make it a part of my work port-folio.
* In future seeing the popularity of this project i can think of making it into an web-app that had more functionality in it like adding more designs and maybe selling it to a existing interior design business.

#### User Stories:
1. As mentioned in the project requirments that this project is more to demonstrate that users are able to use data-bases and perform CURD functionality so my focus is same, therefor there are many images to let user choose between design easily.
2. I would like to have intuative design in navigation so i can surf the website easily so my website is easy to navigate with a nav-bar with clear discription of where it takes me bootstrap did a good job in providing that.
3. As a new user i would like to have all the necessary information infront of me so i don't waste my time looking for what i don't need so the Website has all necessity information on front page.
4. When i see and like the webiste next step would be to login or resigister and the buttons for them are easily seen on navbar.
5. I would like to have options to log-in logout register when i'm on first page for a not-registed/loged in carts and payment are not available.
6. I would like to register quick so to make the process easy the top-right button of sign up seprate log-in and register page that will take user to that page.
7. the footer has privasy and terms of company which is bust links with no information since it is a mock website.

### **Scope**:
This website take approach of MVP (Minimal VIable Product) method which I considered a good for the following reasons:
* It brings out the basic layout of the website and gives awareness to user how the website is going to look like.
* It gives me an opportunity to see my design taking a beautiful shape and improve it where necessary.
* Includes relevent and defining images and buttons to make webpage look more exciting and fullfilling and easy to navigate.
* Testimonials of pervious users to boost the confidence of first time user and to give them a boost that they are at the right web-app.

### **Structure**:
I designed this website in three pages with same navigation and footer section to show consistancy to user and so that they can move around and find register and contact information not matter which page they are on.
All pages have images and buttons and style that fits perfectly with the purpose of the page. and use of images enhances user experience. 
There is a base templated which is extended onto all pages with jinja formatting language that makes the templating very easy.
All pages follow same color theme and almost same design to give user a consistency and ease of use.
### **Skeleton**:
The website is divided into three pages first with information about the web-app and text, icons and placeholders to make is easy to navigate. then there are login and register pages which are seprate, a click on the links in navbar will take user to those pages. then user will be able to see the the cart and payment functionality that was missing when they were not logged in.
 The Wireframes are representation of project's final look.
### **Surface**:
I wanted to make first-time user see what this web-app is about without reading content and i achived it by using relevent images and placeholder text. it would be very easy to see what this web-app is about and how to use it. The use of colors was decided inorder with the color of all pages gives a relevence and consistency to the web-app and makes user in control.
#### Typography:
* I didn't use any font as the web-app is more focused on use of data-base, Django and heroku and with the standard font the desired result was being produced.
### **Features**:
 __Navbar:__ 
 * Navbar is created in dark  color and nav-links with white to give a clear view to user. Navbar is fixed to let user explore the full height of website and having access to the functionality of navbar at the same time.

 __Home Page:__ 
 * After registering or logging in Home page has a Form element with placeholders that gives a full idea to user what this web-app is about and with full name of website which is self-discriptive. i have made 3 different pages so user gets directed to relevent page when they navigate through nav-bar. Then i have feedback section from amazing users and at last the footer with privasy and copyright information which is empty as i mentioned because its a mock project.
 __Register Page:__
 * In Register page i use almost same layout to give consistancy to user and more make them clustered with entirely different dynamics of new page. i used form for registration that will speak with data-base and save the username and password in data-base.
 __login page:__
 * This is a page for users who are already registered and want to login it has almost same structure and and after loging in user will be directed to the home page. the log-out functionality is a function which will remove the session cookie and log user out.
 ### __Features Left to Implement__:
 * I would love to improve this project with more designs so a user has more choices to choose from.
 * i would like to add feature so user can hire the labour aswell which will fix the design the choose.
### Design Choices:
* __Images:__ the choice of images is relevent to the webapp all pages so it is very easy to see what webapp is for and see designs.
 * the place holder text made is easy to navigate the form elements on page.
 
 * __Color:__ Color for the website is dark with light contrast which is color of confidence and strength. To inspire user that is the first step and then they are able to build their dreme home.
 
 * __Layout:__ The website in medium screen is centered on all the pages and there is more content on the landing page. i made this design choice because centered view for medium screen is elegent and easy to read. Which , i think, gives it more aesthatic beauty.
